## ‚ö° Battery Life Impact

PingBerry is designed to run efficiently in the background on BlackBerry 10 devices. It uses a highly efficient Internet of Things (IoT) network protocol ‚Äî **MQTT** ‚Äî which keeps connections lightweight and minimizes battery and data usage while delivering notifications in near real-time.

In real-world usage tests:

- **Test scenario:** 18-hour day, receiving an average of 8 notifications per hour.
- **Result:** PingBerry consumed only **~2.4% of total battery** over the course of the day.

Most of the battery impact comes from decrypting each incoming notification, while maintaining the network connection has a negligible effect. This demonstrates that the service has a minimal impact on device battery life while keeping you connected and ready to receive notifications.
